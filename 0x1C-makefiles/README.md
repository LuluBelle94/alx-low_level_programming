0x1C. C - Makefiles

When a developer runs the make command, the make utility reads the Makefile and determines which files need to be updated based on changes to the source code or other dependencies. It then executes the appropriate commands to build the software, running compilation steps and linking object files together to produce the final executable.

Makefiles are typically used in projects that involve multiple source files or libraries, where it would be tedious or error-prone to manually compile each file and link them together. By automating the build process, Makefiles can save developers time and ensure that builds are consistent across different environments.

Makefiles are often used in conjunction with version control systems like Git, allowing developers to easily build and test code on different branches and merge changes together. They are also commonly used in open-source projects, where contributors may be working on different platforms or with different toolchains.
